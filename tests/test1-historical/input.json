The men's spirits remain high despite the difficult conditions. We received news yesterday that General Lee is planning a major offensive northward. I pray this conflict will soon come to an end.\n\nSupplies are running low. We are down to hardtack and salt pork. The quartermaster promises new provisions by week's end.\n\nI think of you and the children constantly. Please give them my love.\n\nYour devoted husband,\nJames",

The news from Gettysburg has reached us here - we pray for your safe return.\n\nThe children are well. Little Thomas asks about you daily. Elizabeth has begun helping me with the garden, which provides much of our food now.\n\nThe city is transformed. Nearly every building serves as a hospital. I volunteer three days a week rolling bandages and tending to the wounded.\n\nCome home safely to us.\n\nAll my love,\nSarah",

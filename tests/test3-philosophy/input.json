For we seem to be going round in a circle. Knowledge is perception, you say. But perception is knowledge, I say. And so we define knowledge by knowledge.\n\nThe question of the nature of knowledge itself remains. Is knowledge merely true belief? Or is it true belief with an account?",

From the time I became aware of this, I realized that for once I had to raze everything in my life, down to the very bottom, so as to begin again from the first foundations.\n\nBut I have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world—no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something. But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to see that I am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think that I am something. Thus, after everything has been most carefully weighed, it must finally be established that this pronouncement 'I am, I exist' is necessarily true every time I utter it or conceive it in my mind.",

Or, to express myself in philosophical language, all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones.\n\nCustom, then, is the great guide of human life. It is that principle alone which renders our experience useful to us.",

      "content": "CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON\nby Immanuel Kant\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\n\nHitherto it has been assumed that all our knowledge must conform to objects. But all attempts to extend our knowledge of objects by establishing something in regard to them a priori, by means of concepts, have, on this assumption, ended in failure.\n\nWe must therefore make trial whether we may not have more success in the tasks of metaphysics, if we suppose that objects must conform to our knowledge. This would agree better with what is desired, namely, that it should be possible to have knowledge of objects a priori, determining something in regard to them prior to their being given.\n\nThe situation here is the same as that which Copernicus found himself in. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved around the spectator, he tried to see if he might not have better success if he made the spectator revolve and left the stars at rest.",

Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks; and that which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the ideas that are there, it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,—such as are those expressed by the words whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others.\n\n2. All ideas come from sensation or reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:—How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE.",

It is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of human knowledge, that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses; or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind; or lastly, ideas formed by help of memory and imagination.\n\n3. That neither our thoughts, nor passions, nor ideas formed by the imagination, exist without the mind, is what everybody will allow. And to me it is no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense, however blended or combined together (that is, whatever objects they compose), cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them.\n\nEsse est percipi - To be is to be perceived.",

Ancient: Plato's forms and knowledge as justified true belief\n2. Early Modern: Descartes' rationalist skepticism\n3. Empiricist Response: Locke, Berkeley, Hume challenge rationalism\n4. Critical Synthesis: Kant attempts to reconcile rationalism and empiricism\n\n## Reading Order\n\nSuggested order:\n1. Plato (foundation)\n2. Descartes (modern starting point)\n3. Locke → Berkeley → Hume (empiricist progression)\n4. Kant (synthesis)"

We are all right here, your Grandma\nis much better, eats [missing one or two words] deal, and sees every\no[ne who?] comes. Uncle Dave a[nd Aunt?] Meaghe[r?] have been [missing\none or two words] Louis Tribus sent the enclosed last might, do as you\nlike about going to it, I suppose you would want some girl to go with\nyou.

Yesterday it was very hot here, but today it is\ncool and damp. Miss Bennett came on Tuesday, so we are very busy. She\nsaid she saw some of the boys on the car coming from the New Brighton\nCricket grounds one day last week, they had their rackets, one of the\nWright boys had his head all bandaged up, covering his right eye,\nforehead, and nose, he must have got hit pretty hard. Your Grandma is\ndoing very well, the nurse says between two and three oclock [sic] in\nthe morning she has a little attack of shortness of breathing, so that\nshe sits up for a while. Otherwise she gets through the night very well.\nEdith [McReeves?] and her mother were here on Friday Edith was very\nsorry not to see you, she is not exactly pretty, but is ladylike and\nvery pleasant. She is much thinner than she used to be. Mrs Benham and\nher niece were here yesterday Mrs B. is a forlorn looking woman, a great\ntalker. I have not seen any of the girls, I think they know you are\naway. I meant you to take the pink fan with gold sticks to wear with the\npink sateen, I hope your dresses were not very badly creased. To day and\nnight you will be pretty busy, if you wear your white dress to the\nreception, you could put on the cream colored sash, & wear the frosted\n[illegible word] for the neck caught with the crescent I suppose you got\nyour Auntie’s silver pin. I met her on the street as she had just bought\nit. The dogs are all right. Ralph Munroe has been photographing the\nhouse. good bye my precious\n\nLove to Pete & Nellie. Your Mamma\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Gertrude Eccleston 1885 June 22\n\nSt. John’s Rectory\n\nJune 22nd\n\nMy dear Alice,\n\nIt was very nice of you to write me when you are so busy having a good\ntime, I speak from experience as you know. I hope you will get this\nscrawl before you leave for home as I have not delayed in answering. Of\ncourse you are anxious to hear how we are coming on with the May pole, I\nreally think they have improved a little in some ways but Alice it is\nthe most discouraging thing we have ever undertaken We have never had a\nfull rehearsal yet, last time three boys were missing, I think that if\nwe had to practice much monger we would not have any boys, as they are\ngetting tired and disgusted as well as the committee and I don’t blame\nthem one bit, it is such hot weather. We have the stage all up and all\nthe dresses are made, I must say they are not very beautiful, I think\nthey are too long, but I guess they will do, we are going to make the\nchildren sing it is so much better it drowns the noise they make a\nlittle. Those that knew the step in the beginning have forgotten it or\nso it seems, so we just let them hop any way they want to. We have had\none rehearsal on the stage and we have another this aft & one Tuesday\neve of every thing, [Birtwistle?] is coming to play for us and I expect\nit will go much better when he plays. We have the old May pole form the\nGerman Club rooms, with a wheel on the top, so the string don’t get\nmixed up any more which is one blessing, as you can judge from the tenor\nof my letter, I am not very enthusiastic over it, but everyone seems to\nthink it will be all right, anyway it will please the [ordianse?\npossibly misspelling of audience] we expect will be here. The children\nhave sold $70.00 worth of tickets themselves, is’ent that splendid, and\nthey are still selling some, it is splendid the interest they are taking\nin it I think we will easily make $100.00. We have all found Florence\nHodges very hard to work with she has so much to say for herself and she\nmust have the curtain this way & the stage that way so that we are about\nwild, I believe it is all settled amicably at last, but for how long\n“land knows.” Will you be home in time for the circus? I have been away\non a visit for a few day[s] at Ridgewood N.J. at the Palmers and have\nhad a splendid time, brought Gertrude back with me for over Sunday, she\nhas just gone home. You haven’t missed any thing down here as far as I\ncan find out except that play at the Club rooms “Caste”, which I hear\nwas a great success, I was away & did not go but Howard has told me all\nabout it, Mrs De Kay looked magnificently & so did Miss Vyse, the oldest\nMr Walker was the poorest actor and Miss Williams did not do well as she\nhad a part that did not suit her at all a lively saucy kind of a part.\nThen there has been a fair at the Presbyterian church where I should\nimagine they raised Cain from all I hear from the Butlers. Miss Bechtel\nwas there in full glory behind the flower table. Now Alice I might keep\non for ever in this strain but I am smoking hot and awfully hungry. You\nmust be having an awfully jolly time and you will have to tell me all\nwhen you get home, I miss you dreadfully so do come home soon.\n\nLots of love Your friend Trudie Eccleston\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Alice Austen Cornell 1885 June 28\n\nStaten Island Sunday [Missing one or more words] a long time—my\n[deares?]t Child since I saw [you?] and we all say the [house? or\nplace?] is dreadfully quiet, bu[t y]ou are quite right to stay where you\nare having a pleasant time. I hear nothing about the neighbourhood, but\nit must be very quiet. [Lou Batsis?] was married a week ago Saturday,\nand went up in the 4. boat, there was no announcement in the papers, and\nI suppose no r[eceptio]n. I do not see why they kept it so quiet. They\ngo to housekeeping at [missing one or more words] Ernst is better, he\n[has or had] [missing one or more words] trouble with his lung[s?]\n[missing one or more words] this from Miss Bennett [missing one or more\nwords] made me two visits [missing one or more words] in all. We have\n[missing one or more words] making the brown [missing one or more words]\nthe blue sateen, and [missing one or more words] the red [cakes?]. She\nwill come again week after next. You poor child, how do you get on with\nso few underclothes and that white dress, what a bother. I told Miss B.\nabout it, she will try to alter it. The Boat House boys invited the\ngirls of the Fair tables to a Barge party to [Petelers?], I saw them\npass the [missing one or more words] Th[ursda]y evening, I believe it\nwas. [Missing word] Smith asked your [missing one or more words] on the\nboat Saturday [missing one or more words] if you were home yet. [The?]\nSunday school exhibition [missing one or more words] crowded, many could\n[missing one or more words] in, Claire and her [missing one or more\nwords] stood outside. The [missing one or more words] very well, to day\nwas so damp and foggy that I lit my fire to dry the room, [illegible\nname, possibly a dog or cat?] found it out and slept for hours on the\nrug Your Grandma is doing very well, to day she came in to dinner, and\nhelped the soup as usual. She is having her leg dressed with ‘Idiophone’\nwhich has a dreadful chemical smell, [two illegible words] upstairs into\nyour Auntie’s room. One of the cisterns is out, the one [missing one or\nmore words] kitchen, and the oth[er?] [missing one or more words] so\nbadly that I use [missing one or more words] water. Take care of\n[yourself?] dear Child, do not [missing one or more words] too hard, you\nwill [missing one or more words] want a new tennis dre[ss?] [missing one\nor more words] money enough for the [missing one or more words]. I\nsuppose Nellie will be coming to the Island before long, give my love to\nher. Ralph’s new photos of the house are very pretty indeed he thought\nyour scroll work cross was very well done, and he is a good judge. Good\nbye, my dearest I wish I could hear your little whistle Your\naffectionate [Mam]a\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong and Eva M. Hartnell 1885\nJuly 6^(th)\n\nMy dear Alice:\n\nI’ve no doubt but that you will open your eyes when you receive this\nnote; it is a sort of partnership affair, both of us writing at the same\ntime So please excuse penmanship (Eva has a better word but mine must\nanswer.) You will come and go over to Helen’s with us at six o’clock\nwon’t you? Wear just what you please, as I expect to. I do hope there\nwill be no more rain. Hoping to see you later, I am Aff’ly yours\nElisabeth B. Strong July 6th/’85\n\nMonday\n\nMy dear Alice, Bess does not want me to write, but I must say that I\nhope you will come up and go over with us. We are both writing at the\nsame time and as I have very much the worst position you must excuse\nchirography. Isn’t that good? I searched the Dictionary for it. Wear\nyour oldest clothes for it will probably rain again, but do come what\never you do. Have you recovered from Saturday’s spree? I have not as you\nmay see. Rhyme!! Don’t think that I am quite daft It is only one of the\neccentricities of genius. Most lovingly Eva M.H.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 July 19\n\nNew Brunswick July 19th /’85\n\nMy dear Alice:-- Perhaps when you discover that this letter was written\non Sunday you will hesitate about reading it; New Brunswickers are never\ntroubled with such compunctions, but with Staten Island people it may be\ndifferent. You began your letter with a slurring remark about our\n“metropolis” or rather our weather, which was unjust, and words cannot\ndescribe the pain it caused me. However, I will try to forget and\nforgive. Have you heard the song “Forget, Forgive” by the same Composer\nas “Some Day”? Eva is a little crazy over it, and I have to sing it to\nher frequently in order to keep her quiet. Saturday morning after\nleaving you we went down town, and I invested in several songs;\n“Dreaming,” “The Romany Bass,” “By the Blue Sea,” and “Welcome Pretty\nPrimrose” They are all pretty, but the two first I am specially gone\nover, or rather the first two. Thank you very much for your account of\nthe wedding; it must have been a very pretty sight, and I am wishing\nthat some one of my friends would get married and have a military\nwedding. By the way my dear, I did not know that you were open to\ncongratulations, why did you not confide in me? We told Mr. Beebe’s\nfortune here on Friday evening and we found that he was to marry you. I\nbelieve I am to be his second, so you had better not come hear me or I\nmay administer cold poison. He wished me to tell you that his moustache\nis getting on nicely. He has been trying to get up a party to go down\nand call upon you, but I do not think there are many who can go. It\nwould be real fun, and a very pleasant trip, but do not expect us until\nyou see us. You may see Harry Beebe before long, for when a young\ngentleman gets to that point where he wants the postage stamp from a\nyoung lady’s letter, the next thing will be his calling on her quite\noften, even though she may live at some distance. Eva’s father came last\nTuesday morning and expected to start for home with his “little\ndaughter,” next Thursday They are going by steamers to Old Point\nComfort, and are very anxious that some of us should accompany them that\nfar, but there is very little prospect of it. We have not been to\n“tennis” in the morning very much since you left. Our second match game\ncame off last Tuesday evening, but not even the prospect of being\ntreated to cream by the other side could make us win, and we were beaten\n6-1, 6-4. We have found some very pleasant acquaintances in the\nBaldwins, a family from New York who live above us. They have been made\nhonorary members of the tennis club, and come down quite frequently in\nthe evenings. To-morrow morning we hope to be able to do some playing,\nbut the last two or three days have been so dreadfully warm, that even I\nwas daunted. You should have been here the other evening when we had our\nmusicale. Mr. Ludlow with his flute, Mr. Beebe with his violin and your\nlittle friend with her piano. We practiced for an hour or more, and then\nCharlie Ludlow gave us a performance on his accordion. We had jugs,\nwaltzes, classical music, and a lansier danced by four the musician\nincluded. I do not know what is the matter, but I am leaving letters out\nof my words in a remarkable way. Eva sends “lots of love” and will write\nvery soon; she has a message for you. I had not intended to write such a\nlengthy epistle but I trust you will be able to get through it. You must\nsend me just as long an one in return. You had my address correctly\nexcept that you ought put [sic] Care Woodbridge Strong. Write soon\nagain, and believe me Very aff’ly yours Elisabeth B. Strong. P.S. How is\nMr. Ogilby? I ask for Eva’s sake you know.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Eva M Hartnell 1885 July 20\n\ncare M.G. [Murray?] #707 Lucas Place Louisville Ky.\n\nNew Brunswick N.J. July 20th /85.\n\nMy dear Alice: I think you were very unkind not to write to me too, but\nI will forgive you on condition that you answer this epistle soon, and\nat length. We miss you, dreadfully. Life has not been the same to\nseveral young men since you left. Neither have we had anything in the\nway of gaiety since your departure. All joy went with you. Isn’t that\nmelting? Do you know I think it is a great shame I am not a man, I could\nmake love beautifully. But a truce to all this nonsense. I suppose Bess\ntold you in her letter yesterday that Papa has come for me and that we\nexpect to leave Thursday for Louisville. I want to get home dreadfully,\nbut I am not at all anxious to leave N.B. I don’t want to tell\neverything that Bess did, so I will say nothing about the Baldwins\nexcept that they are quite agreeable, and I am only afraid Miss Blanche\nwill prove a rival. We had an engagement with them and C.B.L. at half\npast seven for Tennis this morning. We go there at nine to find the\ngrounds deserted. Were’nt [sic] we mad? Well Sone!! Have you seen Mr\nRobert Ogilby lately? I read the cricket news with the greatest interest\nnow. I never cared anything for the game before, but I begin to think it\nmust be very enjoyable. You may not believe it but I have improved in\nTennis to such an extent, that I am to play in singles against Fred\nDeshler to-night. My Guardian was up to call Friday and he told me to\ngive you a heart full of love for him. He said that his trip to the\nIsland (with you) would ever be a bright spot in his life and that he\nwould never be able to think of it without a thrill of rapture. Poor\nfellow, he has been way down down since you left. I really hate to go\naway and leave him in such a condition. Be kind to him, I pray you for\nmy sake at least. Those are not the exact words that he used, but it was\nwhat he meant I am sure. I intended to write you a sensible letter and\ntry to counteract the impression that you must have of me, but the\nimpishness is in me and must come out. I will wait until I see you to\nfinish that story. It is too long to write. Do write soon. I think I\ngave you my Louisville address—but I will repeat it. Bess sends love.\nWith a great deal from Your very sincere friend Eva M. [Hartnell or\nHartwell]\n\nBessie Hill\n\n[Nettie or Hettie] Hill\n\nBessie Strong\n\nEva [Hartwell or Hartnell]\n\nEmily Neilson\n\nAnnie Ogilby\n\nAlice Austen\n\nMrs P.T.

Austen\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Eva M Hartnell 1885 August 8\n\nLouisville, Ky.\n\nAug 8th 1885.\n\nMy dearest Alice;\n\nYour delightful letter came Thursday, just when I was beginning to think\nI must have said something in my letter to offend you, and that you were\ngoing to give me the “cut direct”. My spirits went up several degrees on\nthe receipt of that letter, (I have been down in the depths since I left\nthe East). Oh my! how jolly you are!!! I do wish I were hear enough to\nhave a chat with you, for I can not say all I should like on paper. We\nhad a delightful trip home. The sea voyage was simply lovely. As we\npassed the Island I thought of you and blew you a kiss. Did you get it?\nI was not at all sea sick much to my delight, for I was teased mightily\nbefore I left N.B. and was told that there was no chance for me. The day\nwe left N.B., by the time I got to New York I was almost in tears. Papa\nwas really worried I was so glum and disagreeable. (So different\n[illegible mark] from the way I usually am!). We had a number of things\nto attend to and then went to have lunch. Just as we came out of\nDelmonico’s who should we meet but Fred [Deshler?] Dear me! I was so\nglad to see him! He walked to the elevated station with us, so that he\nwas the last friend I saw. It is delightful to be at home again after\nhaving been away for over a year, There have been a great many changes.\nIt seems to me that every one I know is married or dead or something. I\nhave been very quiet as yet, and have only had a few callers, but next\nweek I anticipate a gay time. I think I may possibly go to Indianapolis\nfor a short visit, and if I do I will have no end of fun, as it is the\nloveliest place to visit I was ever in. Every one does so much to\nentertain you. I had a very cordial [illegible word] from Douglas\nShirley (the Author of the Inner Sisterhood you know) the other day. I\nsaw a splendid burlesque on his latest book the other day, and if I can\nget a copy I will send it to you. He sued the man who published it, so I\nmay not be able to get one, but I shall try. Douglas is such a case! I\nhope he will call soon, so I can have some fun. My dear have you not\nsome sort of a picture of yourself that you can send me? Even a tintype\nwould be very thankfully received. Can’t you and Mr Robert Ogilby have\none taken together? He in his cricket suit and you in your tennis\ncostume. I think you had better, but at any rate, send me some sort of a\nphoto of yourself. I want it for my rogue’s gallery. (That is to pay you\nback for saying I would not care whether there were chaperones or not).\nI certainly did not tell my brother about any resemblance in the picture\nand I no longer carry it in my pocket book. What do you think of that? I\nam glad you congratulated Bess, for it shows me that you had no designs\non “her False love” for my dear you have captured my Guardian’s heart,\nand no mistake. I was not the only one who noticed it. My dear my\nmessage was better than yours after all, for a large part of mine was\ntrue, while yours was all made up. How I laughed over that letter! I\nread it about six times. And now for a sweet message for “Bob”. What\nshall I say? That he is my own true love? I can’t, for that’s not true.\nThat if he trys [sic] he may some day be my own true love? I can’t, for\nthere is not the slightest possibility of such a think. That I send my\nkindest regards and hope he may win you for his true love? Yes, I think\nthat will do very nicely. I do hope I shall see you in New York next\nwinter. I will not be at #33 Lex Ave as I have changed my boarding\nplace, but I will keep you posted as to where I will be. I am living on\npeaches and watermelon. Does not that sound choleric for you? If you can\nwade through this dreary epistle you will do well. I should advise you\nto take it a little at a time. Don’t wait so long to answer this please,\nand do send the photo. I will be at #707 Lucas Place until the last of\nSeptember. With oceans of love, As ever your friend Eva M. Hartnell\n\nSaturday.\n\n#707 Lucase Place\n\nLousiville Ky.\n\nc/o N.G. [illegible name beginning with M].\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Julia Bredt 1885 August 8\n\nAug. 8th 185 west Bethlehem Dearest Alice, I was so glad to hear from\nyou. I have written two or three times and have not had any answer so I\nguess you have not received them (my letters) in one of them I sent the\ntin types of the children & one of myself. It is funny But never mind, I\nwill send them again when they have them taken. The children are getting\nup an entertainment and they are in this room talking away at a fine\nrate so you must excuse mistakes. All the children have been away Carl\nis away now it seemed so funny without them. I have had [company?] all\nSummer & have not been away at all I play Tennis a great deal & I like\nit ever so much, we have a very pretty set & we play on a very lovely\ncourt so altogether it is very nice. I do not know if I shall go away\nthis summer if I do I am going in a week or so I most likely will come &\nstay a day or so with Emily, & so will be almost sure to see you if I am\nnot on the Island I will try & come over & see you from [illegible word]\nI am if it is not [illegible word]. I do not feel like beginning school\nagain at all the summer has passed so quickly—[Lella?] is staying with\nme now & she told me all about the wedding also her sister who is\ningaged [sic] [to?] Lieutenant Allen went [to?] it & she said it was\nlovely I had a letter from Emily yesterday and she said that you had\nbeen playing Tennis at E. Wrights, do you still like it as much as ever?\nWe had a very nice time last evening, went to play Tennis in the first\nof the evening and then Mr. Boothe played the Guitar & he sang it\nsounded very pretty. I must say good bye now I do hope you will write\nvery soon [In?] care [of?] if I do go away I will go in a week or so,\n[illegible word] Mama’s & my love to your grandmama--& all the children\nsend love I am your loving friend Julia Frederika Bredt\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 August 12\n\nLittleton, Mass.\n\nAugust 12th /’85\n\nMy dear Alice:-- To say that I was very glad to receive your letter\nwould be putting it mildly; but you were so long about answering my\nlengthy epistle, that I was worried and feared it might have proved too\nmuch for your feeble constitution. Another idea that occurred to me was,\nthat you might have eloped with one of those cavalry officers I know\nthat you were much impressed by them, and as you are naturally rather\nsusceptible, I thought your better judgment might have given way to the\nimpulse of the moment. I was on the point of interviewing your Aunt,\nwhen the long-looked-for letter made its appearance. It was followed a\nday or two later by your note urging us to come to Staten Island, but\nafter the threat you implied for some harmless remark I had made, it\nwould not be safe for me to be in your neighborhood. It is very kind of\nyou to want to see us, but just now we (“the crowd”) are “scattered to\nthe four winds”. Etta Macaulay is at Martha’s Vineyard; Charlie Ludlow\nat Ocean Beach, the Desher boys were there for last Sunday also I\nbelieve; Harry Beebe is at Saratoga; the Hills, I suppose, are in New\nBrunswick though I do not know, and [Doni?] and I are in Mass., as you\nhave perceived doubtless. We were not really in earnest when we spoke of\nmaking a descent upon you, for I do not think we could get up a partly\nmuch as we should enjoy it. One of these days, however, when I invade\n“the Island” (not Blackwell’s) you will see enough of me. We left home\nlast Friday at noon, and after a most tedious journey, arrived here at\nnoon the next day. The only amusement I had after leaving home, was in\nwatching the urchins dive off the wharf at Hew York. They did not\ntrouble themselves to take off any clothes, except in one instance, when\nthe boy did not take the trouble to put any on. Then I was interested in\nsomething the other side of the boat. But most of them jumped in just as\nthey came from the streets, and if one of them objected to a bath, his\ncompanions would pick him up and drop him overboard. Really it was very\namusing. You may wonder where Littleton is, and what sort of a place it\nis. Well, it is about thirty miles from Boston on the Fitchburg road,\nand did, last May, boast a population of nine hundred and ninety-four.\nBut some of the inhabitants have since died, and as there has not been a\ncorresponding number of births, I suppose they are further from a\nthousand than before. The scenery and the drives about the neighborhood\nare beautiful, but I never walk much while here. I range between the\nhouses of an Uncle and an Aunt, and know comparatively few people beside\nmy relatives. My days are passed in driving, reading, working, eating,\nplaying with the children, and making myself generally agreeable(?) and\nlast, but most emphatically not least, sleeping. There are four\ngenerations in this house; the oldest an old lady of ninety-one and the\nyoungest a young lady of five months. As you may imagine there is\nnothing wildly exciting about this life, but I thoroughly enjoy it\nnevertheless. Next week, I believe there is to be a Sunday-school\n“picnic” and then my bliss will be complete. But of all things I should\nlike to be here in the winter and attend a “Boxborough ball”. Boxborough\nis a village about [from, possibly mistake for four or five?] miles from\nus, and I was told last evening that at these balls, the gentlemen are\nin the habit of dancing in their stocking-feet and sometimes in their\nshirt-sleeves. Imagine it! Wouldn’t you like to see one? If you have\nseen the play “Joshua Whitcomb” you have seen a very good representation\nof the way in which such things are managed in these rural districts.\nAunt Lucy has promised to invite me here next winter for one of the\n“select parties” in the town-hall, which she says are very funny. I had\na long letter from Eva on Monday, in which she complained of not having\nheard from you. But hers was sent last Wednesday (5th) before she would\nhave had time to receive yours. So you think Eva and I “conspired\ntogether” before writing you? No my dear, and I did not see anything\nmysterious about my letter; I cannot speak of hers. You ask about the\nBaldwins. We have found them very pleasant, but just now like other\npeople, they are not “in town”. I knew Mr. Martin was coming to visit\n“Harry” as you irreverently call him but did not see either of them\nwhile he was in New Brunswick. Mr. H. Baldwin spend Sunday at Staten\nIsland two or three weeks ago. Is not Mr. Martin a brother of your\nparticular friend? We have been invited up to the Baldwins’ two or three\ntimes, to play tennis and spend the evening, and we like them all very\nmuch. I only wish they could be persuaded to spend the winter at our\nmetropolis. You invited me to write a longer letter “next time” and tho’\nI did not intend to spin it out so, it has lengthened itself out without\nmy realizing it. Be a good girl and write me soon, and suppose you try\nten pages “next time”. I do not know how ling I shall be here, but\nprobably for two weeks at any rate. Do not become venturesome and get\ndrowned diving off that dock. Charlie Ludlow said when I wrote you again\nto send his regards, and say he hoped we should see you in New Brunswick\nbefore long. “So say we all of us”.\n\nMost aff’ly yours Elizabeth B.S\n\nMy address— Care Col. J.A. Harwood Littleton Mass.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Gertrude Eccleston 1888 August 27\n\nViault House\n\nLake Mahopac\n\nAug. 27^(th)\n\nMy dear Alice; Your prompt letter calls for a speedy reply so here goes.\nI think the pictures you sent me to look at splendid, of course they are\na little faded, but I am sure the success of that lense [sic] is beyond\ndoubt and am glad you own it. Mr Manner saw the tennis groupe [sic] and\nwanted me to ask you if you could allow him to pay for one he thought it\nso good of himself & the others. Do as you like about it but I think you\nneed not pay any attention to it. The Collins think the pictures\nsplendid and they each want one of the groupe. Have you got your camera\nwith you now? Mr B. is still here, he will spend another week here as it\nagrees with him so well, he has gained three pounds already I remain the\nsame. Nellie Lord was up here for a week & Jack and George Betts came up\nfor Sunday. There was a large ball at the Thompson House Saturday night,\nwe all went over in full dress costumes. The big dining room was all\nfixed up and they threw different colored lights on the dancers which\nmade a lovely effect, the red light was immensely becoming but the green\n& blue were gastly [sic], they call it [fantom?] dancing. There were\ncrows of people there and I almost danced myself sick as I was not\nreally fit to dance a step. We had a great time watching that Miss\nMichael she had a fight with her lover and gave all her dances to\nanother man she has treated him horribly it is the talk of the hotel, I\nwould give a good deal to know what the trouble is. The tennis court it\n[sic] swarming with men from morning until night and unless I walk over\nwith my racket (which by the way is a perfect beauty) & a partner to\nhold me up I never get a chance to play at all. Fortunately they do not\nuse my net any more. Harry Wright wrote me such a smart letter enclosing\na [illegible word] of original poetry about my defeat. I wrote back in\nmy truest style thanking him for the racket. He got me a rough handle\nbecause the other kind are only made to order and in quantities. I can\nplay finely with it and hope to be able to win something “some day”. I\nhad a letter from Jule and she is playing in a tournament at Ridgefield\nor where ever she is, she had great times with [Konrad?] & Pussie;\npaddling and fishing. I miss you very much indeed my dear ad feel quite\nlonely in my huge room. The Collins go to [Rize?] this Friday and we\nleave here in the 7th. The people are beginning to go away & I say good\nriddance to bad rubbish. Now then farewell and write soon. The family &\nfriends in general wish to be remembered to you. With Love, ever your\nfriend Trudie.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Grace Hustace Simonson, 1885 August 28\n\n2020 Fifth Ave. N.Y.\n\nAug 28th 1885\n\nMy dear Alice,\n\nI meant [to have answered] your letter before [this, but] you know how\neasy [it is to] put it off from [time to time?] especially when you\n[have] nothing particular to write. I was down on the Island when at the\nBrittons when your letter reached me. I made quite a long visit there;\nand tried to go down and see you, but it was during the hottest weather\nand when the mosquitoes were [at] the thickest, so that [cousin?]\nHarriet did not like [us to drive] the horse so far. [I expected?] to\nhave made [a visit at?] my Aunt’s but [find that] it is not likely [I\nshall] be able to go there. [At any rate?] if my seeing you depends on\ngoing there it is highly probable I shall not see you this summer. So I\nwant you to come up and spend the day with me very soon. Next week I am\ngoing away for a few days but after that any time would be perfectly\nconvenient for me. You can send me a card the day before if you like.\n[If any?] of the girls will come with you I should like very much to\nhave them. [Please come?] you never have yet. [It is so?] long ago since\nI [wrote?] you that I have most [forgotten] what has happened since. I\nworked hard at Cooper all winter and was all tired out by summer. I am\njust beginning to feel myself again. Did you know that I took one of the\nfirst prizes in the school? It rather repaid me for working so hard. I\nsuppose I shall go back [in] October but not to study [so hard?]. I am\ntaking [lessons in] china painting and like it ever so much though have\nnot done much yet. [Do or So?] you play tennis as much as ever. [T]his\ncool weather is just the thing for it. We have to be contented here with\ncroquet. They allow us to play on the lawns in [Mt.?] Morris park and we\nenjoy it so much. Wednesday I had a splendid game with a young gentleman\nfriend and today I played with [my cousin?] Sophie is pretty [well?] but\nshe has been [illegible]able, and at one [time we?] were very much\n[bothered?] about her. I guess [her party?] will not be very soon. I\nhave not thought of my [illegible word] dress yet. I shall have to\nfinish now as I am so sleepy; it is pretty late and we have had such\nlots of company this week that I am all tired out. Please give my love\nto your Mamma [and?] Grandma and with much for yourself I remain your\nloving friend Grace\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Julia Bredt 1885 August 8\n\nAug. 8th\n\n185 west Bethlehem\n\nDearest Alice,\n\nI was so glad to hear from you. I have written two or three times and\nhave not had any answer so I guess you have not received them (my\nletters) in one of them I sent the tin types of the children & one of\nmyself. It is funny But never mind, I will send them again when they\nhave them taken. The children are getting up an entertainment and they\nare in this room talking away at a fine rate so you must excuse\nmistakes. All the children have been away Carl is away now it seemed so\nfunny without them. I have had [company?] all Summer & have not been\naway at all I play Tennis a great deal & I like it ever so much, we have\na very pretty set & we play on a very lovely court so altogether it is\nvery nice. I do not know if I shall go away this summer if I do I am\ngoing in a week or so I most likely will come & stay a day or so with\nEmily, & so will be almost sure to see you if I am not on the Island I\nwill try & come over & see you from [illegible word] I am if it is not\n[illegible word]. I do not feel like beginning school again at all the\nsummer has passed so quickly—[Lella?] is staying with me now & she told\nme all about the wedding also her sister who is ingaged [sic] [to?]\nLieutenant Allen went [to?] it & she said it was lovely I had a letter\nfrom Emily yesterday and she said that you had been playing Tennis at E.\nWrights, do you still like it as much as ever? We had a very nice time\nlast evening, went to play Tennis in the first of the evening and then\nMr. Boothe played the Guitar & he sang it sounded very pretty. I must\nsay good bye now I do hope you will write very soon [In?] care [of?] if\nI do go away I will go in a week or so, [illegible word] Mama’s & my\nlove to your grandmama--& all the children send love I am your loving\nfriend Julia Frederika Bredt\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 October 7\n\nNew Brunswick Oct. 7th/’85 My dear Alice: I purposely waited until after\nyour tennis tournament should be over before writing to you, hoping that\nyou would afford me an opportunity for congratulating you on a glorious\nvictory. I have been searching the paper each morning for news of you\nand was highly delighted when I saw you had beaten two of your\nopponents. But yesterday news was not what I wanted to see, and now it\nis my painful duty to condole with you. Your name has been appearing in\nprint a great deal lately my dear; so far I have heard nothing very\ndreadful, of you however. Cousin Evie sent me one of the Staten Island\npapers containing an account of the “Cricketers’ Ball;” from it I\nlearned that “Miss Austen was attired in White nun’s veiling, profusely\ntrimmed with lace, a pearl necklace and pearls on her hair.” Did you\nhave a good time? Mr. Baldwin told me he went with your party, and was\ndancing with Miss Eccleston when she sprained her ankle. It must have\nsomewhat spoiled the fun for all of you. I would have given a great deal\nto have stayed for the Ball; Cousin Evie urged me very much to do so and\nheld out all sorts of inducements for a longer visit. If I had had a\nparty-dress with me I don’t believe I could have withstood the\ntemptation. However we had a most delightful time at the phantom party\nat Mrs. [Wells’?] the same evening, and the Thursday evening following\nwe all met again at a “Progressive Euchre” party at the Deshlers’. Of\ncourse I took no prize; it is against my principles to do such a thing.\nOur last gaiety was a “dove” or “hen” tea-party given by Mrs. Dr. Rice.\nIt was very small, only about fourteen girls being invited but we had a\nvery pleasant time. I have been indulging in a new sort of work lately\nwhich could hardly be called “fancy-work,” at any rate I do not fancy\nit! Isn’t that most atrocious, but I beg any number of pardons and won’t\ndo so any more! The work referred to is housework and O, how, I detest\nit! We have been without servants for more than a week, and though we\nhave a waitress coming (?) next Wednesday still we have as yet engaged\nno cook. New Brunswick is particularly destitute of that article of\nfurniture just now, and I cannot get Mother to try in New York. However\nI hope “better times are coming,” and that we shall be settled one of\nthese days. Have just received a letter from Eva; she is very much\npleased with her hew home and her school, and everything in fact. Her\nnew address is 105 West 40th; care Mrs. S. J. Seymour, but probably she\nhas already sent it to you. Have you developed that plate yet? But I\nimagine that the tournament has not allowed you much time or thought for\nanything else. I am waiting patiently for that picture of yourself you\npromised me. Doesn’t the proverb run “Patient waiters are no losers”?\nLet us hope it will be proved correct in this case. How is the\nEnglishman who [illegible word] the camera or rather two cameras; does\nhe come over three times a day as usual? You should have been at church\nlast Sunday evening; our choir rose in numbers to sixteen, and the\nbehavior was what might have been expected. Without doubt Dr. Woodbridge\nis one of the most patient in existence. I hope you will not form a very\nbad opinion of me for sending such a looking letter, but my ink and pen\nare both on a strike and I am too lazy to hunt up better. Please\nremember me to your mother and to Mrs. Miller, also to Miss Wright when\nyou see her. I have as yet had no time to pursue my study of chiromancy\nbut hope to do so “some-day.” With much love to yourself, and hoping\nsoon to hear from you I am Aff’ly yours Elisabeth Briard Strong.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from E Bruce 1885 November 2\n\n57 Broadway 2 Novr 1885 Dear Miss Austin [sic]/ Our straw-ride of last\nThursday has been turned into a dance at the boat house for next\nThurs-day –5th inst. Please come and have a jolly time. Mrs MacDonald\nand others will matronize the party. We will meet about eight o’clock,\nYours sincerely [illegible name beginning with E] Bruce\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Grace Hustace Simonson, 1885 November 3\n\n2020 Fifth Ave N.Y.\n\nNov. 3rd 185 [sic]\n\nDear Alice\n\nDon’t we keep up a rushing correspondence, actually I am ashamed of you.\nNow I have had some excuse; doing a great deal of everything and not\nmuch in particular since I saw you last. But seriously when are you\ncoming up. The weather Will not be any pleasanter later, can’t you come\nsometime next week, that will give you plenty of time to get ready. Last\nweek we were all busy at a fair for the benefit of our church. It was an\nextremely pretty one though I believe not financially successful. The\nladies in charge of different tables chose the holidays in the year and\ndressed their tables to represent them Christmas day was a lovely little\ncottage covered with snow (cotton) and greens. Washington’s birthday a\ntent. April day an immense umbrella of white and pink mull and glass\nbead [sic] sewed on for rain. May day a large may pole with the colored\nnet caught to different parts of the table. Thanksgiving day the\nprettiest of all, a thatched cottage with husked corn, pumpkins and fall\nfruits and flowers brought in as decorations. I took a dreadful cold the\nlast day and have not been out of the house since but getting better\nfast. I am not going back to Cooper for the present, I may after\nChristmas but possibly not until next year. I want to try and get over\nmy colds first. But I have my china painting and once can always find\nplenty to do here. What are you thinking of doing this winter? Though it\nis not much use to plan is it? Please let us hear from you soon, and let\nit be favorably, give my love to all the friends and with much for\nyourself. I remain Sincerely yours Grace\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 November 7\n\nNew Brunswick.\n\nNov. 7th/’85\n\nMy dear Alice:\n\n-- I’ve only been waiting to see what gaiety was in the wind before\nsending for [one or two missing words, possibly you] to come and m[one\nor two missing words, possibly make me] a visit. My pat[one or two\nmissing words] met with its re[one or two missing words] the 4th of\nDecember there is to be a “calico-ball” and we are anticipating any\namount of fun. It is not yet decided where it will be held but probably\nin the “assembly room.” Now my dear, I want you to say that you will\ncome over and be here for New Brunswick’s great event. Give me as long a\nvisit as you can—and only let me know what day and hour to expect you\nand I will meet you [one or two missing words, probably at the] depot. I\ndo not know exactly [one or two missing words, probably what] sort of\ncostumes [one or two missing words] allowable at th[e ball?] but\nsomething in the fancy-dress line I presume, and of course they must be\nof “calico.” In this case, that term may be stretched to mean almost\neverything that is not silk, velvet, or woolen. Do not get up anything\nelaborate or you will outshine me. We certainly are going back to\nsummer; the heat is really oppressive. I am hoping that it will clear\noff to-day so that we shall have a pleasant evening for the organ\nrecital at the Second Reformed Church. Of course you have heard through\nyour [one or two missing words] the new organ that has been [one or two\nmissing words] there; I hear Prof. Austen is to pla[… one or two missing\nwords or partial words, first word possibly play …]he performer this\nevening wi[th? one or two missing words] Clarence Eddy and we expect a\ngreat treat. Next Wednesday there is to be a Progressive Euchre party at\nMiss Bessie Palmer’s. I do not think you met her last summer did you?\nLast [one or two missing words] was a small [one or two missing words]\nat Dr. Scott’s [one or two missing words]or [for?] his sister, but [one\nor two missing words] not go because [one or two missing words]adache\n[headache?] but heard it was a very pleasant affair. But I must not\nwrite more now. O, I am so stupid and sleepy this morning; please excuse\nall deficiencies. Had a letter from Eva yesterday; has she written you\nlately? Hoping soon to hear from you—I am with much love Yours aff’ly\nElisabeth B. Strong\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Annie Hedley 1885 November 9\n\nNovbr [sic] 9th/85. Dear Alice, Will you join a few friends and take\nlunch with Annie on Thursday next in a very informal manner. She would\nlike to have you and hopes you have no engagement. Lunch at one o’clock.\nWith love to your Grandmother, Mother and Aunt I am Your Friend Annie\nHedley, R.S.V.P. Clifton.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 November 19\n\nPiermont Nov. 19th/85 My dear Alice:-- I am ever so glad you can come\nbut shall suggest a slight change of plan, that is as regards the\n“Calico-ball” itself. A day or two after I wrote you the date was\nannounced as the 11th, though the ball had previously been advertised to\ncome off on the 4th. You will certainly give me a visit of a week, will\nyou not? From Thursday until Monday is such a short time. About the\ndresses; there will be all sorts I suppose, but the managers are anxious\nthe girls should war something bright and if the effect be old fashioned\nso much the better. However if you would rather wear thin white do so.\n[Satins or Satines, possibly misspelling of Sateens?], cambrics,\n[silicias?, possibly misspelling for silesias] or anything of that sort\nwill answer. I have a red arrangement, part of a German peasant costume\nor something of that sort. I shall probably wear that, and get a red and\nwhite striped skirt to go with it if I can. I large white mull kerchief,\nand a swiss cap trimmed with red ribbon complete the costume that I\nshall probably wear. As you will see I am away from home; left New\nBrunswick yesterday A.M., and expect to be here until next Tuesday or\nWednesday. Eva will spend Thanksgiving with us. This morning my cousin\nand myself went out in the village cart, taking with us a young\ngentleman for company and protection. This evening he is coming with his\ncousin, sister and brother to play whist. By the way I have had my\nfortune told, and I find that I am to meet my fate on the banks of the\nHudson. Now Piermont is situated on the Hudson, but that does not mean\nnecessarily that we are to meet here, does it? Saturday we expect to be\nat my uncle’s at New Brighton for the day. I shall think of you as not\nbeing so very far away. My dear, I have attained the advanced age of\ntwenty-one years, but I fail to see that people treat me with an\nincrease of respect. Can you not come about the time you had fixed even\nthough the “event” is postponed. Write again and let me know the day and\nhour when I am to expect you. Yours with much love Elisabeth B. Strong\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 December 2\n\nNew Brunswick.\n\nDec. 2nd/’85\n\nMy dear Alice:\n\n-- It will soon be only a week until the “Ball,” and after that the days\nwill fly away, particularly if I am not ready, and need more time;\notherwise seven days will seem an endless while. You may think me\nslightly incoherent but the prospect of so much dancing, and with plenty\nof room to spread yourself in is proving too much for my equilibrium.\nBesides I have a mild headache this evening so am not quite responsible\nfor any vagaries you may find in this letter. My chief [missing word or\ntwo ending in t] in writing you [one or two missing words] that if you\ndo [not?] want the bother [one or two missing words ending in-ting,\nprobably of getting] up a [costume for?] the occasion, white [will?] do\nperfectly well. I have not spoken to many of the girls about dresses but\nthere will be some white ones worn I am sure. I have been hunting about\nfor material for a skirt, and have at last found something that will\nanswer, though it is not exactly what I was looking for. The next thing\nis to make it up, and that part I do not enjoy much; still it will be as\nplain as can be. Yes, I remember Miss Martin and her brother. On further\nacquaintance what did you think of Mr. Baldwin? But you can answer that\nquestion after you get here. I am getting impatient to see you, and am\nlooking every day for the letter which will tell me when to expect you.\nBy the way, are you fond of afternoon teas? There is to be one given by\nthe [Misses Janeway?] and Miss [missing name which] we will take [one or\ntwo missing words] would like. It [one or two missing words] on the 12th\n(Sat.) [Please remember?] me to [your?] mother and aunt and believe me\nwith much love for yourself Aff’ly yours Elisabeth B. Strong\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Elisabeth B. Strong 1885 December 8\n\nNew Brunswick\n\nDec. 8th/’85\n\nMy dear Alice:\n\nI’ll just scratch you off a “few” lines to let you know that I fully\nexpect you to-morrow morning and will be at the station to meet you.\nShall get through with my French lesson just about in time to meet your\ntrain. But my dear I cannot think of your going home on Saturday; you\nsurely can stay longer, and I am depending on you to go with me to Miss\nJaneway’s “tea.” Mother does not go into society at all nor entertain\nthis winter otherwise I should give some sort of a company while you are\nhere. As it is I have asked no end of people to call, and you certainly\nmust give them a chance to do so. Thursday evening there is to be a\nrehearsal of the play we are getting up, to which I shall take you\nunless you have serious objections. We had our first rehearsal last\nevening at the Hills’, and had great fun. The grand finale comes on the\n1st of January at Mr. Hill’s. But my hands are stiff and writing is\nattended with great difficulties. Tell your mother she must not expect\nyou on Saturday, and not until she sees you. With much love, farewell\nuntil to-morrow. Aff’ly, Elisabeth.\n\nLetter to Alice Austen from Julia Bredt 1885 December 8\n\nDec 13/85—\n\nWest Bethlehem\n\nDear Alice,\n\nI always get mixed up when it comes to whose turn it is to write but I\nthink I wrote last and have never had an answer, am I not right? It\nseems such a long time since I have seen or heard from you but I do hope\nthis letter will reach you and that you will answer very soon. I can not\nthink what to begin and tell you about as I am not sure what will\ninterest you I still go to school and do all the children last winter I\ntook private lessons, but this year the lady that taught me has started\na school & I go to it, do you go to school now? I do not think you do;\nin your last letter you told me the Island was very quiet—is it in the\nsame state of repose now? Bethlehem is such a funny place for a week or\nso it will be very very lively & then there will be nothing going on for\na great while Last Friday The Mustard & cheese club have a dramatic in\nthe [Lun?] Hotel it was splendid & the room crowded the name of the\nFarce was “The silent protector.” Last year the same party gave one with\nfew additions. Then Saturday evening there was an entertainment in the\nschool hall given b the Moravian school the one to which [Trunie,\nTrumie, Trinie or Trimie?], Fritz & Arthur Go. I did not go to it as\nFritz was not well & I stayed home, but Mama & all the rest went & they\nsaid it was very good. I am very anxious for it to get cold so we will\nhave skating I enjoy it so very much & we generally have it pretty good.\nI have never skated but on the canal & smaller creeks & ponds, but when\nthe River freezes every one says it is splendid. I am afraid it won’t do\nthat this year. The first or second day after Xmas I am going to be in\nNew York or Brooklyn, at least, that is, if nothing happens & I hope you\nwill be in New York & we can meet each other. Now Alice do answer this\nsoon & I will have to say good night, as I am so sleepy I don’t know\nwhat to do lost [sic] of love from all & remember us all very kindly to\nyour Grandmama & keep lots for your self I am as ever Your\naffectionately J.F.
